        <p></p>The local paper boys, also known as the 'Newsies' are going on strike.
            The cause is the recent increase in the cost of papers to them. The
            cost of papers to the public is remaining the same, cutting into their
            already minimal profit of 3 cents down to 2 cents a paper.

            Their questions to Pultizer and Hertz is plain "Aren't you rich enough already?"
