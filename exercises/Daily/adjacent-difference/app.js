// Adjacent Difference
// 12 JULY 2017
// Given an array of strings, find the 3 adjacent elements with the longest combined length. Return them in the form of an array.

// Example:

// For const inputArray = ["this", "is", "an", "array"], the output of combined(inputArray) should return ["is", "an", "array"] because they have the longest combined length of any 3 adjacent elements.

//for loop to go through the array
// inside the loop check .length of array i, i + 1 and i + 2
// save the three results into Max.
